<h1>Word Predictor in C</h1>

<br>
This was a project for my Computer Science 1 class. The program will read an input file that should look like the following:

<hr size="1">
<h3>FILE</h3><br>
Number of lines of the file<br>
Choice / Word / How many times word appears*<br>
.<br>
.<br>
.<br>
.<br>
.<br>
<hr size="1">
* = This won't be included unless the choice being selected is number one, since we need to know how many times a word shows up to properly add then to the dictionary and later on perform the predictions<br><br>

Choices can be either:
<ol>
  <li>Adding a word to the dictionary</li>
  <li>Predict the next word</li>
 </ol>
